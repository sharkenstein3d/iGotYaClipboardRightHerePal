                <div class="step step1">
                    Open a terminal window, and navigate to the directory where the Clipboard Wizardry script resides.
                </div>
                <div class="step step2">
                    Activate your virtual environment, if you have one, with the incantation: <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
                </div>
                <div class="step step3">
                    Invoke the script by uttering the command: <code>python wizard.py</code>
                </div>
                <div class="step step4">
                    Your faithful Clipboard Wizard will sense the contents of your clipboard automagically! If you've copied two file paths from your code editor, the wizard will decode them.
                </div>
                <div class="step step5">
                    Behold! The wizard will provide you with the import incantation you seek.
                </div>
                <div class="step step6">
                    If you are importing a CSS module to your component file, the wizard will say, "Ah, it seems you're importing a CSS module to your component file. Here's the format: <code>import styles from 'your_import_path';</code>"
                </div>
                <div class="step step7">
                    If you're importing one SCSS file into another, the wizard shall declare, "You're importing one SCSS file into another. Here's how you can do it: <code>@import 'your_import_path';</code>"
                </div>
                <div class="step step8">
                    If the wizard is unsure of your intentions, it may respond with, "I'm not sure what you're trying to do. Please check your file paths."
                </div>
                <div class="step step9">
                    The incantation shall be copied to your clipboard, ready for your coding adventures!
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="goodbye">
